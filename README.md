Repo for Learn IT, Girl project

## What is Learn IT, Girl Program? 

This program was born as the project of the Romanian and Polish recipients of the **Google Anita Borg Scholarship** in 2014 as a way to help realize Anita Borg's vision of 50% women in computing by 2020. ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è

**"Learn IT, Girl!"** is an international mentorship program, which means that every woman accepted as a scholar will be guided by a mentor. üòç

Any woman of any age can apply to become a scholar, as long as they want to learn a programming language. The mentors will help you to learn by doing, they will give you resources, answer your questions, and help you understand how coding works. To make it a bit more fun, the mentors and the scholars will be from different countries. üíª
